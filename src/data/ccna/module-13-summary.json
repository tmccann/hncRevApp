    "ICMP is used by both IPv4 and IPv6 for error messaging",
    "Ping uses ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply",
    "Ping confirms reachability and measures round-trip time",
    "Ping does NOT show the path or intermediate routers",
    "Traceroute (tracert) shows each hop along the path",
    "Traceroute uses ICMP Time Exceeded messages",
    "Traceroute sends packets with increasing TTL/Hop Limit values",
    "Each router decrements TTL; when TTL=0, router sends Time Exceeded",
    "Ping 127.0.0.1 or ::1 tests local TCP/IP stack installation",
    "Pinging default gateway tests ability to reach other networks",
    "Cisco ping output: '!' = success, '.' = timeout, 'U' = unreachable",
    "ICMP doesn't guarantee delivery - it just reports problems",

    "ICMP is Layer 3 protocol (Network Layer)",
