    "Cost is typically the most constrained factor in small network design",
    "Redundancy is more important to large corporations than small businesses",
    "Modularity protects investment by allowing future expansion",

    "Voice traffic typically has highest priority through network",
    "QoS minimizes latency for real-time applications",
    "Network baseline should be established at regular intervals over time",
    "True redundancy requires second router AND second ISP",

    "show ip interface brief shows IP addresses and up/down status",
    "CDP can be disabled globally or per-interface",
    "CDP operates at Layer 2, doesn't require Layer 3 connectivity",
    "Fixed-interface devices less flexible for growing networks",
    "Port density should match current and projected needs"
