      { "id": "d", "text": "Redundancy" }
    ],
    "correctAnswer": ["d"],
    "explanation": "Large corporations prioritize high availability. Redundancy—duplicating routers, links, and power supplies—ensures business continuity if a component fails. Small businesses often avoid this extra expense due to lower complexity and tighter budgets."

    ],
    "correctAnswer": ["d"],
    "explanation": "Modularity allows devices to be upgraded with expansion modules for more ports or features as the business grows, protecting the initial investment. Fixed-interface devices are less flexible and can become bottlenecks in a growing infrastructure."
