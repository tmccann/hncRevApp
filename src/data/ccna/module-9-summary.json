    "ARP maps Layer 3 IPv4 addresses to Layer 2 MAC addresses",
    "ARP only works on the same local network/subnet",
    "ARP Request uses broadcast MAC address: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF",
    "ARP Reply is unicast directly to the requesting host",
    "ARP table is stored in RAM (volatile memory)",
    "Command 'arp -a' displays the ARP cache on Windows/Linux",
    "Static ARP entries include broadcast addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.255 → FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)",
    "For remote destinations, ARP resolves the MAC of the default gateway/router",
    "IPv6 uses Neighbor Solicitation/Advertisement (NDP) instead of ARP",
    "Switches flood unknown unicast frames out all ports except the ingress port",
    "Switches flood broadcast frames out all ports except the ingress port",
    "RAM holds: routing table, ARP cache, running-config",
    "NVRAM holds: startup-config (persistent)",
    "Flash holds: Cisco IOS image",
    "ROM holds: bootstrap program and POST diagnostics"
