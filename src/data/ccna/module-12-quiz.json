    "correctAnswer": ["a"],
    "explanation": "IPv6 compression involves removing leading zeros in each hextet and replacing the longest single contiguous sequence of zero hextets with '::'. For 2001:0DB8:0000:AB00:0000:0000:0000:1234, we drop leading zeros and compress the final four zero blocks into '::'. Note that '::' can only be used once."
