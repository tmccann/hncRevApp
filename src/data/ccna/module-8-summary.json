      "title": "MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)",
      "description": "The data link layer passes the MTU value up to the network layer. IP uses this to ensure packets don't exceed the physical medium's size limits, fragmenting if necessary."

    "Layer 3 encapsulation adds source and destination IP addresses",
    "Routers forward packets based on destination IP address only",
    "IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses; IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses",
    "IPv6 header is simpler and more efficient than IPv4 header",
    "The loopback address is 127.0.0.1 (used to test local TCP/IP stack)",
    "Packets on the same LAN are sent directly without using the default gateway",
    "Packets to remote networks are sent to the default gateway first",
    "TTL (IPv4) or Hop Limit (IPv6) prevents packets from looping forever",
    "Each router decrements TTL/Hop Limit by 1; packet dropped if it reaches 0",
    "Destination IP address stays the same during transmission; TTL changes",
    "The MTU is determined by Layer 2 and passed to Layer 3",
    "IP is connectionless; reliability must be handled by upper layers (TCP)",
    "netstat -r (Windows) displays the routing table",
    "show ip route is a Cisco IOS command, not a Windows command"
